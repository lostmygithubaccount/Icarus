# Icarus Investments

***work in progress***

## setup

Clone the repo:

```bash
gh clone lostmygithubaccount/icarus-investments
```

Change into it:
    
```bash
cd icarus-investments
```

Probably setup a virtual environment (an exercise left to the reader).

You should probably install `just` and use the commands in the [`justfile`](justfile), but you can just `pip install .`. Then the `icarus` CLI is available. Use it to generate data and run stuff.
